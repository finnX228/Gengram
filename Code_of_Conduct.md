## Our Pledge

We are committed to fostering an open, inclusive, and respectful community.
As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to make participation
a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, and religion.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our project include:

 - Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
 - Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
 - Taking responsibility for mistakes and learning from them
 - Focusing on what is best for the project
 - Showing empathy towards other project members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

 - The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances of any kind
 - Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
 - Public or private harassment
 - Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
 - Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any individual for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including but not limited to:
- GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Project-related communication channels and community activities
- Situations where an individual is representing the project in public spaces

This Code of Conduct also applies outside project spaces when there is a reasonable belief that an individual's behavior may negatively impact the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting the project team at opensource@zhejianglab.org. 

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is committed to maintaining confidentiality with regard to reporters, consistent with applicable policies and laws. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time, and the suspension of any licenses granted under the applicable agreement. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community. Any licenses granted under the applicable agreement shall terminate effective on the date the Permanent Ban decision is made.

## Responsible Use of AI-Generated Content
We recognize the value and potential of generative AI tools in supporting research, development, and collaboration within this project. At the same time, contributors are expected to use such tools responsibly
and in alignment with the project’s principles of integrity, transparency, and scientific rigor.

When using generative AI to contribute to this project, contributors are expected to:

- Take responsibility for all submitted content, regardless of whether it is generated or assisted by AI tools.
- Review, validate, and, where necessary, revise AI-generated content before submission to ensure correctness, relevance, and clarity.
- Apply appropriate domain knowledge and professional judgment to verify factual accuracy, technical soundness, and consistency with project goals.

Responsible use of AI-generated content helps maintain trust, collaboration,
and the overall quality of the project. Misuse of AI-generated content,
including submitting unverified or misleading material, may be treated as
a violation of the project’s Code of Conduct.
